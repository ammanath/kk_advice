KK : 'It’s my birthday. I’m 68. I feel like pulling up a rocking chair and dispensing advice to the young ‘uns. Here are 68 pithy bits of unsolicited advice which I offer as my birthday present to all of you.'

## About the application

A pretty simple  application that lists out the 68 bits of advice. 
I plan to use it for reference and as a quick read when the mind wanders.

 'You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.'
